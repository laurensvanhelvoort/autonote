We assume that no transitions are defined for any final
state, so the TM will halt whenever it enters a final
(accepting) state.
• Unfortunately it is not always possible to require that a
TM halts even if it does not accept.
• TMs that always halt, regardless of whether or not they
accept, are a good model of an algorithm. If such an
algorithm to solve a given problem exists, then we say
that the problem is decidable.



No special input file and no special output device. Only
tape!
